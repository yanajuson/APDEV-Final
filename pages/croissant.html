            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Today we’re conquering our fears and making homemade croissants! If you’re about to run away screaming, I understand. I’m not sugarcoating it: croissants aren’t easy. Croissants require time, patience, and a lot of rolling. However, just because
                this recipe is advanced doesn’t mean that YOU have to be an advanced baker to try it. You can absolutely handle this recipe. <br><br> Let me hold your hand through the whole process. I’m sharing step-by-step photography, a full video tutorial,
                plenty of tricks based on what I’ve learned, and the croissant recipe. I started working on croissants earlier this year. I studied a couple recipes, tested them, tweaked what I found necessary, and played with this dough for weeks. The
                croissants are golden brown, extra flaky, crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, and unbelievable warm from the oven. One bite of this delicate French pastry will immediately transport you to a quaint French bakery. I’m confident in
                this homemade croissants recipe and I’m confident in YOU baking them.

        <div class="ingredients">
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup (4 Tablespoons; 60g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
                <li>4 cups (500g) all-purpose flour (spoon & leveled), plus more for rolling/shaping</li>
                <li>1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
                <li>1 Tablespoon active dry or instant yeast</li>
                <li>1 and 1/2 cups (360ml) cold whole milk</li>
                <li>FOR BUTTER LAYER: 1 and 1/2 cups (3 sticks; 345g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature and 2 Tablespoons (16g) all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>FOR EGG WASH: 1 large egg, 2 Tablespoons (30ml) whole milk</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="directions">
            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Make the dough: Cut the butter in four 1-Tablespoon pieces and place in the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment. Add the flour, sugar, salt, and yeast. Turn the mixer on low-medium speed to gently combine
                    the ingredients for 1 minute. With the mixer running, slowly pour in the milk. Once all of the milk is added, turn the mixer up to medium speed and beat the dough for at least 5 full minutes If after 5 minutes the dough is too sticky,
                    keep the mixer running until it pulls away from the sides of the bowl.</li>
                <li>Remove dough from the bowl and, with floured hands, work it into a ball. Place the dough on a lightly floured silicone baking mat lined. Gently flatten the dough out and cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Place the entire baking
                    sheet in the refrigerator and allow the covered dough to rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Shape the dough: Remove the dough from the refrigerator. Begin flattening out the dough with your hands.The dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep working the edges with your hands and rolling pin until you have the correct size rectangle.</li>
                <li>Long rest: Place the rolled out dough back onto the baking sheet (this is why I prefer a silicone baking mat or parchment because you can easily transfer the dough). Cover the rolled out dough with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, place
                    the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator and allow the covered dough to rest in the refrigerator for 4 hours or overnight. (Up to 24 hours is ok.)</li>
                <li>Butter layer: In a large bowl using a hand-held mixer or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and flour together until smooth and combined. Transfer the mixture to a silicone baking mat lined or parchment
                    paper lined baking sheet. Using a spoon or small spatula, smooth out into a 7×10-inch rectangle.Place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator and chill the butter layer for 30 minutes. </li>
                <li>Laminate the dough: Place the butter layer in the center of the dough and fold each end of the dough over it. If the butter wasn’t an exact 7×10-inch rectangle, use a pizza cutter or sharp knife to even out the edges. Seal the dough edges
                    over the butter layer as best you can with your fingers. On a lightly floured counter, roll the dough into a 10×20-inch rectangle. Fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter. This was the 1st turn.</li>
                <li>If the dough is now too warm to work with, place folded dough on the baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate for 30 minutes before the 2nd turn. I usually don’t have to.
                </li>
                <li>2nd turn: Turn the dough so the short end is facing you. Roll the dough out once again into a 10×20-inch rectangle, then fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter. Place the folded dough on the baking sheet,
                    cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate for 30 minutes before the 3rd turn.</li>
                <li>3rd turn: Roll the dough out once again into a 10×20-inch rectangle. Fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter.</li>
                <li>Long rest: Place the folded dough on the lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight. (Up to 24 hours is ok.)
                </li>
                <li>Shape the croissants: Remove the dough from the refrigerator. On a lightly floured counter, roll the dough out into an 8×20-inch rectangle. Using a pizza cutter or sharp knife, slice the dough in half vertically. Each skinny rectangle
                    will be 4-inches wide. Then cut 3 even slices horizontally, yielding 8 4×5-inch rectangles. Cut each rectangle diagonally to make 2 triangles. You have 16 triangles now. Work with one triangle at a time. Using your fingers or a rolling
                    pin, stretch the triangle to be about 8 inches long. Cut a small slit at the wide end of the triangle, then tightly roll up into a crescent shape making sure the tip is underneath. Slightly bend the ends in towards each other. Repeat
                    with remaining dough. Loosely cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and allow to rest at room temperature (no warmer– I suggest keeping on the counter) for 1 hour, then place in the refrigerator to rest for 1 hour or up to 12 hours.
                </li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C).</li>
                <li>Egg wash: Whisk the egg wash ingredients together. Remove the croissants from the refrigerator. Brush each lightly with egg wash.</li>
                <li>Bake the croissants: Bake until croissants are golden brown, about 20 minutes. Rotate the pans halfway through baking. If croissants show signs of darkening too quickly, reduce the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                <li>Remove croissants from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool for a few minutes before serving.</li>
